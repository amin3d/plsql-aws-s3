# Oracle PL/SQL AWS S3 with HTTPS
Please help me improve this API with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for S3 (Simple Storage Service). AWS has upgraded their 
S3 services and the API to include an encrypted HTTP interface. The very good work done by the team that included
Morten Braten and Jason Straub pre-dates the HTTPS API. Furthermore, the transition to HTTPS was not as simple as adding
and 'S' to the call. 

As of February 2017, I have taken the package to the level that is needed for my company. It is possible to:

1. List objects (files)

2. List all buckets

3. Upload an object

4. Delete an object
