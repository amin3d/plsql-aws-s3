# Commenting
Comments are good.

## Referencing AWS Documentation
Steps that follow AWS Documentation should have links to those steps. And where possible, use variable names and 
flow statements that resemble the AWS stuff.

## Functions / Procedures
First, please do document their function.

Second, please do paste in working sample code as a template for running the procedure from outside the package. 

## Tabs/Spaces
Sorry, I like tabs as tabs with a value of 2. 

## Caps
I don't care much for caps. I do notice that I capitalize parameters. I couldn't justify that to a sole.
